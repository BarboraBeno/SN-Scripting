Well-designed client scripts can reduce the amount of time it takes users to complete a form.

DOCS:
Client script allow the system to run Javascript on the client (web browser) when client-based events occur, such as when a form loads, after form submission, or when a field changes value.

Use client scripts to configure forms, form fields, and field values while the user is using the form.

    - onLoad()
    - onSubmit()
    - onChange()
    - onCellEdit()

Client script can:
	- Make fields hidden or visible
	- Make fields read only or writable
	- Make fields optional or mandatory based on user roles
	- Set the value in one field based on the value in other fields
	- Modify the options in choice list based on user role
Display messages based on a value in a field

OnCellEdit

OnCellEdit Client script is typically used, when you want your client script logic to run, if the user is changing in the list edit view of servicenow.

These scripts do not apply to List Widgets on homepages or dashboards

One of the parameter is callback => a callback continues the execution of other related cell edit scripts

You must pass back either true or false in the callback function. If true is passed as a parameter, the other scripts are executed or the change is committed if there are no more scripts. If false is passed as a parameter any further scripts are not executed and the change is not committed.
