Client script an UI policy both execute client-side logic and use the same API.
Both are used to manage forms and fields.

UI Policies execute AFTER Client scripts. If there is conflicting logic the UI policy logic applies.

Healthscan recommend to use UI Policies Instead of Client Scripts

Client script
    - Execute on form load
    - Execute on form save/ submit / update
    - Execute on form field value change
    - Have access on form field's old value
    - Execute before UI Policy
    - DOES NOT set field attributes with no scripting
    - Require control over order of execution (customize the form to add it)

UI Policy
    - Execute on form load
    - DOES NOT execute on form save/ submit / update
    - Execute on form field value change
    - DOES NOT have access on form field's old value
    - Execute after Client script (overwrite the logic)
    - Set field attributes with no scripting
    - Require control over order of execution
