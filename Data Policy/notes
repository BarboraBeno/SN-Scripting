Data Policies enforce data consistency by setting mandatory and read-only field attributes. 
Unlike UI Policies, Data Policies execute server-side. UI Policy logic only applies to data entered in a form.
 Data Policy logic executes regardless of how a record changes. 
 Developers cannot apply scripts to Data Policies.
