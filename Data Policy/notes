Data Policies enforce data consistency by setting mandatory and read-only field attributes. 
Unlike UI Policies, Data Policies execute server-side. UI Policy logic only applies to data entered in a form.
 Data Policy logic executes regardless of how a record changes. 
 Developers cannot apply scripts to Data Policies. 

 For example, suppose that you are configuring a web service that allows users from outside the platform 
 to update problems on the ServiceNow instance. Since these problems are not updated through 
 the instance UI, they are not subject to the UI policies on the problem form. 

 Since UI policies can also manage the visibility of fields on a form, 
 you may want to augment UI policies with data policies rather than replace them.
