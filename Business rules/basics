A business rule is a server-side script that runs when a record is displayed, inserted, updated, or deleted, or when a table is queried.

Use business rules to accomplish tasks like automatically changing values in form fields when certain conditions are met, 
or to create events for email notifications and script actions.

Time the business rule should run
	- Before
	- After
	- Async
	- Display

Database operation that the system takes on the record 
	- Insert 
	- Update
	- Query (Before a query for a record or list of records is sent to the database. Typically you should use query 
    for before business rules)
	- Delete


Primary purpose of the Display business rule is to populate g_scratchpad object. When a user requests a record 
form data is read from the database display rule is executed and the client script has access to the g_scratchpad object and values. 

Async business rule is executed after records are inserted/modified/queried
Run asynchronously as sheduled jobs
