UI policies dynamically change the behavior of information on a form and control custom process flows for tasks.
For example, you can use UI policies to make the number field on a form read-only, make the short description field mandatory, and hide other fields. Basic UI policies do not require any scripting, however for more advanced actions, use the Run scripts option.
You can also use client scripts to perform all of these actions, but for faster load times use UI policies when possible.


	- Number field read only
	- Short description field mandatory
	- Hide fields

Although a UI Policy can evaluate any field in a record regardless if it is visible to the end under, the field specified in a UI Policy Action does need to be present on the form.

Conditions are only re-evaluated if a user manually changes a field on the form, if the change is made by the system it is not re-checked.
